## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I build custom integrations that connect tools, services, and platforms - using APIs, scripts, and automation to reduce manual effort, sync data, and make systems work together smoothly.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You're manually exporting/importing data between tools
- You want to pull external data into your reporting environment
- Your automation needs more flexibility than built-in connectors offer
- You need to integrate multiple systems or stitch together cloud services
- You want to automate recurring tasks without relying on fragile UIs

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Writing **clear, reusable scripts** that solve specific problems
- Handling **authentication, pagination, and edge cases** gracefully
- Making integration logic **portable and version-controlled**
- Logging and documenting workflows for **traceability and debugging**
- Using **lightweight tooling** for fast development and low overhead

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Reliable connections between tools, APIs, and data sources
- Less manual work and fewer missed syncs
- Scripts you can read, run, and reuse - not black boxes
- A smoother, more connected internal toolchain
