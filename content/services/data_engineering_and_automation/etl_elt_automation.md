## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I automate the processes of extracting, transforming, and loading (or staging) data - whether it follows an ETL or ELT pattern - so teams can work with clean, up-to-date, and accessible data without depending on fragile manual steps.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You're manually moving or cleaning data on a regular basis
- Your current ETL jobs are slow, error-prone, or undocumented
- You're juggling spreadsheets, APIs, and databases without a unified flow
- You want to standardize your data refresh across systems or teams
- You need a maintainable and transparent process that just works

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Designing **automation that fits the data's shape and the team's needs**
- Using **parameterization and modular structure** for reusability
- Applying **version control and logging** for traceability
- Choosing ETL vs ELT intentionally based on performance and control
- Making sure workflows are **easy to monitor, extend, and maintain**

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Faster and more reliable data updates
- Fewer manual handoffs or patch fixes
- Clear lineage and process ownership
- Automation that scales as your data ecosystem grows
