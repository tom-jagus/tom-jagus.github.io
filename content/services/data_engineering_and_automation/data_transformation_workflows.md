## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I design workflows that transform raw, inconsistent, or multi-source data into a clean and usable state. This includes logic-heavy shaping, business rule application, and preparing data for modeling, reporting, or further automation.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You're spending too much time reshaping or cleaning data manually
- Your transformation logic is spread across disconnected scripts or spreadsheets
- You need to apply consistent business logic across datasets
- Your data sources are messy, nested, or require normalization
- You want traceable, versioned transformation pipelines

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Applying **structured, layered transformations** (e.g., raw â†’ staged â†’ clean)
- Making business logic **transparent and testable**
- Avoiding unnecessary complexity - **simple where possible, robust where needed**
- Designing workflows to be **modular, reusable, and easy to maintain**
- Aligning transformations with **upstream and downstream needs**

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Clean, consistent data that's ready for reporting or modeling
- Fewer manual data prep steps and one-off scripts
- Clear logic that's easy to validate and troubleshoot
- Transformation workflows that scale with your data volume and structure
