## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I design pipelines that move data from source to insight - cleanly, reliably, and with minimal manual overhead. Whether it's APIs, spreadsheets, databases, or cloud platforms, I focus on shaping pipelines that serve real business logic, not just move bits around.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You need a pipeline to pull and clean data from multiple APIs or flat files
- Youâ€™re manually wrangling Excel sheets that could be automated
- Your reporting system depends on fragile data refreshes
- You want to standardize how raw data is collected, validated, and shaped
- Youâ€™re integrating siloed systems and need a consistent data flow

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Making pipelines **maintainable, modular, and traceable**
- Aligning data movement with **real reporting or analytical needs**
- Automating away **repetition and fragile manual steps**
- Designing flows that are **version-controlled and portable**
- Minimizing complexity while preserving flexibility

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Fewer manual tasks and failure points in your data workflows
- Consistent, validated inputs to your models and dashboards
- Scalable processes that can grow with your team or business
- Clear visibility into where your data comes from and how itâ€™s handled
