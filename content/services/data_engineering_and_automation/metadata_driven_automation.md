## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I build automation systems that adapt to metadata - allowing workflows to scale across tables, datasets, or reporting assets without duplicating logic. This approach reduces maintenance, improves consistency, and makes change easier to manage.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You have similar logic repeated across multiple scripts, reports, or pipelines
- Changes in structure or logic require too many manual edits
- You're building a reporting layer across many datasets or regions
- You need flexible workflows that respond to dynamic input
- You want more maintainable and modular automation

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Structuring metadata so it can **drive logic, not just describe it**
- Building **parameterized workflows** that adapt to inputs
- Reducing **hardcoded values and repeated logic**
- Applying consistent structure across **data models, transformations, and outputs**
- Making it easy to **update one place, not many**

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Scalable automation across similar data structures
- Easier updates, fewer breakages, and faster iteration
- Clearer governance and standardization
- Workflows that evolve without starting from scratch
