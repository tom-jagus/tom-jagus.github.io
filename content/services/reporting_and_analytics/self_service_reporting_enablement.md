## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I help organizations create reporting environments that support self-service - not chaos. That means building models, processes, and standards that let analysts and business users work independently, without compromising data trust or consistency.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- Analysts are stuck waiting on developers to build reports
- Business users want more flexibility but lack clear guardrails
- Metrics and definitions differ across teams or departments
- Your model or dataset isn't structured for intuitive use
- You need a framework that balances access with accountability

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Structuring models for **easy exploration and reuse**
- Defining and documenting **clear metrics and dimensions**
- Establishing **governance patterns** without blocking innovation
- Creating templates, naming conventions, and onboarding guides
- Bridging the gap between technical and non-technical users

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Faster, more confident reporting from business teams
- Consistent metrics across self-service and managed reports
- Fewer bottlenecks for the data team
- A culture of ownership, clarity, and trust around data
