## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I design Power BI models that do more than just visualize data - they clarify it. My focus is on building robust, well-structured semantic layers that support real-world decision-making, not just checkboxes on a dashboard.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You're working with slow, overcomplicated reports and unclear metrics
- Your business logic lives in Excel or SQL scripts instead of reusable models
- Teams are building ad-hoc dashboards with inconsistent definitions
- You need a model that can scale across users and reporting layers
- You're not confident in the accuracy or performance of your current setup

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Modeling metrics and dimensions that align with **business meaning**
- Creating **clear, reusable calculation logic** using DAX and TMDL
- Designing models that stay **performant** even as data grows
- Structuring semantic layers to be **transparent and maintainable**
- Balancing flexibility for power users with guardrails for consistency

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Faster, more responsive reports your teams trust
- Shared understanding of key metrics and definitions
- Easier onboarding and smoother collaboration across analysts
- A reporting foundation that scales with your organization
