## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I work with teams to streamline their analytics workflows - identifying where effort is wasted, where clarity is missing, and where better structure can unlock faster, more confident decisions.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- Your analytics team is busy but not effective
- Business questions take too long to answer or keep getting re-asked
- Data prep, modeling, and reporting feel disconnected
- Documentation is scattered or missing
- Teams spend more time debating numbers than using them

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Mapping and refining **end-to-end analytics workflows**
- Improving **hand-offs between analysts, engineers, and business teams**
- Promoting **shared logic, repeatable processes, and reusable components**
- Bringing clarity to **roles, tools, and expectations**
- Helping teams focus on **outcomes, not just output**

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Smoother, faster delivery of analytics work
- Clearer ownership and better collaboration across roles
- More reuse, less duplication
- A system that supports smarter decisions - not just more reports
