## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I improve the performance of Power BI reports and data models by identifying bottlenecks, refining DAX, optimizing query plans, and reducing unnecessary load - all without sacrificing clarity or flexibility.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- Your reports take too long to load or refresh
- Performance drops with larger datasets or more users
- Users are frustrated by laggy visuals or timeouts
- Your DAX measures are complex and difficult to debug
- You want to ensure your model scales without rewrites

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Profiling and simplifying **slow or expensive queries**
- Refactoring **DAX logic** for efficiency and clarity
- Reducing model size and improving **column/storage behavior**
- Applying **best practices around relationships, cardinality, and filtering**
- Making performance optimizations without creating technical debt

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Faster load times and smoother user experience
- Reports that scale with more data, more users, and more questions
- Fewer workarounds and more maintainable logic
- A reporting environment people actually enjoy using
