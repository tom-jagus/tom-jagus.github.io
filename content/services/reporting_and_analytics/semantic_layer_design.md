## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I design semantic layers using DAX and TMDL that turn raw tables into understandable, business-aligned models. These models support consistent analysis, clear metric definitions, and high-performance reporting across teams and tools.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You need consistent metrics across multiple reports or teams
- Business logic is buried in report-level formulas or ad hoc queries
- Your model feels slow, redundant, or hard to manage
- Teams interpret KPIs differently due to inconsistent definitions
- You're moving toward a semantic layer strategy (e.g. Power BI, Fabric)

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Modeling **explicit, reusable business logic**
- Organizing measures, dimensions, and tables with **clarity and structure**
- Writing efficient, readable **DAX** for performance and maintainability
- Using **TMDL** to standardize model structure and simplify version control
- Enabling **trust, reuse, and scale** across the reporting environment

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Shared understanding of key metrics across teams
- Faster, more consistent reporting development
- Models that are easier to validate, extend, and reuse
- Business users and analysts working from the same reliable definitions
