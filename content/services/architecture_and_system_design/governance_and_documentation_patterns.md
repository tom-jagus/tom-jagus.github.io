## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I help teams build practical governance and documentation patterns that make work more visible, decisions more traceable, and systems easier to understand - without slowing things down or creating unnecessary overhead.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- No one's sure how or why something was built
- Knowledge lives in people's heads, not shared docs
- You're growing quickly and things are getting harder to manage
- There's confusion about ownership, process, or handoffs
- Documentation is either too sparse or too dense to be useful

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Defining **clear ownership, naming, and change control**
- Creating **modular documentation** that's easy to write and update
- Embedding documentation where work happens - not in separate silos
- Helping teams adopt governance that's **visible but lightweight**
- Supporting **onboarding, reuse, and institutional memory**

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Easier collaboration and handoffs
- Systems that are clearer to extend, maintain, or revisit
- Less confusion and duplication across teams
- A documentation culture that actually sticks
