## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I help teams plan and structure their data and reporting environments - choosing the right tools, models, and architecture to support the kind of insight and agility they actually need, without overcomplicating the stack.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You're setting up a new data or reporting platform and want to get it right
- Your current setup has grown messy, slow, or fragmented
- You're not sure how to structure models, sources, or report layers
- Teams are duplicating effort or working with inconsistent data
- You need a roadmap that aligns technical capabilities with business goals

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Designing **layered, scalable structures** for data and reporting
- Choosing tools that fit the **size, skillset, and goals** of the team
- Clarifying **ownership, governance, and refresh flows**
- Creating environments that are **easy to use and maintain**
- Avoiding overengineering while building for growth

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- A clean, well-structured data and reporting environment
