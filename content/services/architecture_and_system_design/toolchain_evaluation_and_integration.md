## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I help teams assess their current toolset, identify gaps or redundancies, and integrate the systems that actually serve their workflow. Whether it's picking the right platform or making tools talk to each other, the goal is to reduce friction and improve flow.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You're choosing between platforms, tools, or data services
- You've outgrown spreadsheets or ad hoc scripts
- Tools aren't integrated, and handoffs feel manual or brittle
- You're duplicating data or logic across systems
- You want a more intentional, streamlined tech stack

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Understanding the **real needs behind the tools**
- Evaluating tradeoffs across cost, flexibility, and maintainability
- Designing **integrations that fit your workflows**
- Reducing tech sprawl while improving utility
- Ensuring the stack can grow without locking you in

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- A toolchain that fits how your team actually works
- Fewer handoffs, duplications, or manual gaps
- Easier onboarding and better alignment across tools
- Clearer, more connected systems that scale with purpose
