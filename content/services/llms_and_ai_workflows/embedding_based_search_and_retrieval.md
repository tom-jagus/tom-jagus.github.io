## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I build search systems that use embeddings to understand meaning - not just keywords. These workflows match questions to relevant documents, messages, or data points, making it easier to surface insight from unstructured sources.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You want to query internal knowledge without building a rigid search index
- You're building a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system
- You need better ways to find relevant documents, tickets, or notes
- Teams are spending time manually digging for context
- You want to improve LLM performance with reliable source grounding

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Structuring **embedding-based retrieval flows** (e.g., via RAG)
- Using **chunking, metadata, and indexing strategies** to improve match quality
- Integrating search into tools, bots, or workflows
- Ensuring **traceability of results** (where it came from, why it matches)
- Keeping pipelines efficient, testable, and maintainable

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Smarter, faster access to the information that matters
- Fewer missed insights hidden in unstructured data
- More accurate and grounded LLM responses
- A scalable foundation for knowledge-driven AI tools
