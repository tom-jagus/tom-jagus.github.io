## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I design practical workflows powered by large language models (LLMs) that extend human capability - automating analysis, answering context-heavy questions, and simplifying complex tasks. These aren't chatbots - they're tools built to solve real problems.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You're manually summarizing reports, emails, or meeting notes
- You want to surface insights across messy or unstructured content
- You're exploring LLMs but unsure how to integrate them into real workflows
- You're repeating the same kinds of analysis or writing patterns again and again
- You need smarter automation that adapts to context â€” not just rule-based triggers

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Building **LLM workflows that augment existing processes**, not replace them
- Designing with **clarity, traceability, and fallback logic** in mind
- Integrating LLMs where they **reduce effort or improve quality**, not just for novelty
- Using **prompt engineering** and embedded context to tailor outputs to real business needs
- Prototyping fast, then validating usefulness before scaling

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Reduced time spent on repetitive analysis and content creation
- Easier access to insights across docs, messages, and systems
- Smarter internal tools that respond to real user needs
- Faster experimentation with LLM capabilities in a structured way
