## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I develop and tune prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) to deliver consistent, business-relevant outputs - whether for automation, analysis, or internal tools. It's not just about getting a response - it's about getting the right one, reliably.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- Your prompts produce inconsistent or unclear results
- You're trying to automate tasks but need better control over responses
- You're using LLMs internally but not sure how to guide them effectively
- You want to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy
- You're prototyping tools that need robust prompt logic under the hood

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Writing **structured, context-aware prompts** for clarity and control
- Designing **prompt templates** for repeatability and scale
- Using **chain-of-thought, system-role, or few-shot techniques** where appropriate
- Embedding business logic directly into prompt flow
- Iterating and testing for **reliability across scenarios**

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- More predictable and useful LLM responses
- Prompts you can trust to perform under variation
- A clear strategy for integrating LLMs into business tools or workflows
- Faster prototyping with fewer false starts
