## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I provide mentorship that helps individuals and teams grow in areas like data modeling, automation, and system design - through code reviews, pair sessions, workflow guidance, and the kind of advice you can apply right away.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- You have junior or mid-level team members that need structure and feedback
- Team members are solving problems, but inconsistently or with extra effort
- You want to improve internal standards, but don't have bandwidth to lead it
- Onboarding is slow or uneven across projects
- You're introducing new tools or practices and want support during the transition

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Making complex topics **approachable and actionable**
- Reinforcing **clear, reusable patterns** through real-world examples
- Adapting to each team's experience level and tech stack
- Sharing feedback that's **collaborative, not prescriptive**
- Mentoring in ways that improve both confidence and consistency

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Stronger, more confident contributors
- Faster learning and fewer repeated mistakes
- Better code, models, and workflows across the board
- A team that shares more - and siloes less
