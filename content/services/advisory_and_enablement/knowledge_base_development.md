## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I help teams design and maintain internal knowledge bases that actually get used - combining structure, relevance, and accessibility so information supports day-to-day work, not just onboarding.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- Important knowledge lives in peopleâ€™s heads or scattered chats
- You've got documentation, but no one knows where to find it
- New hires rely on tribal knowledge or repeated walkthroughs
- Teams repeat mistakes or decisions because history isn't visible
- You want a clearer, shared foundation as you grow

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Organizing content around **how teams actually work**
- Making knowledge findable, skimmable, and maintainable
- Capturing not just the "what" - but the **why and how**
- Creating systems that evolve with your team
- Encouraging contribution without gatekeeping

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- Faster onboarding and easier handoffs
- Fewer repeated questions and rediscovered mistakes
- A more confident, better-informed team
- Documentation thatâ€™s trusted - and actually used
