## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I help teams plan and evolve their internal tooling - from reporting and automation utilities to AI-enhanced workflows. The goal is to invest in the right tools, with the right scope, for the problems that matter most.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- Internal tools are outdated, inconsistent, or scattered
- You've been building reactively - now you want a clear strategy
- Some teams are duplicating work, others are blocked
- You want smarter tools, but don't want to over-engineer
- It's unclear who owns what, or how tools are maintained

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Mapping current tooling and identifying **gaps, overlap, or opportunity**
- Prioritizing improvements based on **impact and simplicity**
- Designing tools that are **focused, testable, and maintainable**
- Aligning internal tools with **team skill sets and workflows**
- Helping teams build less - but build better

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- A clearer roadmap for internal tooling
- Better collaboration and shared standards
- Reduced manual effort and tool sprawl
- Tools that actually support the way your teams work
