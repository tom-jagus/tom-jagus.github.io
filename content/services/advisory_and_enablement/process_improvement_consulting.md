## ðŸ§© What This Covers

I help teams spot friction in their day-to-day work and design better ways of getting things done - without reinventing the wheel or adding unnecessary complexity. It's about improving outcomes, not just changing processes.

## ðŸ›  Common Scenarios

- Work is getting done, but it feels harder than it should
- There's confusion or inconsistency around how tasks get completed
- Too much time is spent coordinating instead of delivering
- Manual steps or one-off tools are holding the team back
- You want to scale without losing clarity or momentum

## ðŸ“Œ What I Focus On

- Understanding **what's really happening**, not just what's written down
- Identifying **repetition, friction, or handoff failures**
- Streamlining workflows using **automation, structure, and better tooling**
- Keeping changes light, modular, and easy to adopt
- Improving **transparency, accountability, and ownership**

## ðŸš€ Outcomes You Can Expect

- More focus on value, less wasted effort
- Clearer roles and repeatable workflows
- A system that supports progress instead of slowing it down
- Better outcomes without more overhead
