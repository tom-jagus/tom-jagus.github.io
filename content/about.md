{{< alert "comment" >}}

I design, develop, and deliver systems that simplify complexity, automate what matters, and enable smarter decision-making. My work bridges data, code, and architecture to help businesses reduce friction, gain clarity, and move forward with confidence.

## üß≠ Who I Am

I'm someone who thrives on solving meaningful problems - not just writing code or building dashboards, but uncovering what really needs fixing and making it better. My background blends data, systems thinking, and a strong bias toward action.

Whether I'm architecting a solution, engineering a workflow, or mentoring a team, I bring structure, empathy, and momentum to every project. I care deeply about building tools people actually use - tools that reduce friction, surface insight, and scale with clarity.

I believe that well-designed systems don't just improve performance - they empower better decisions and create healthier, more resilient ways of working.

## üß† How I Work

I approach every project with a balance of structure and adaptability. Whether I'm working independently or embedded in a cross-functional team, I aim to bring clarity, reduce ambiguity, and keep momentum moving forward.

My process is iterative, outcome-driven, and grounded in real business needs. I ask the right questions up front, ship in small, confident steps, and document decisions as I go - because long-term value comes from systems that are clear, maintainable, and easy to pick up.

I thrive in environments that value feedback, trust, and purpose. While I prefer agile principles, I know how to apply them flexibly - even in more rigid or legacy-driven workflows.

## üß∞ What I Build

I build systems that make data useful, automation sustainable, and insights actionable.

That includes:

- **Automated data pipelines** that extract, transform, and integrate data across platforms
- **Reporting systems and semantic models** that deliver trusted, decision-ready insight
- **LLM-powered tools and workflows** that augment analysis, streamline tasks, and surface deeper context
- **Architecture and process design** that reduces friction and scales with clarity
- **Custom scripts, interfaces, and automation layers** that remove repetition and create momentum

Whether it's a self-service dashboard, a robust backend pipeline, or an AI-augmented workflow, I focus on building things that simplify the complex and deliver lasting value.

## üß± Tools & Technologies

My daily toolkit spans data platforms, scripting languages, automation tools, and AI systems - everything I need to move from raw input to real insight.

Some of the technologies I rely on most:

- **Power BI** & **Microsoft Fabric** for modeling, reporting, and scalable delivery
- **Power Query (M)**, **DAX**, and **TMDL** for building robust semantic layers
- **Python** & **SQL** for scripting, automation, and data engineering
- **LLMs**, prompt engineering, and generative AI tools for insight acceleration and intelligent automation
- **Tabular Editor**, **DAX Studio**, and **Excel** for modeling, diagnostics, and validation
- **Git**, **Neovim**, and terminal-based workflows for versioned, repeatable development

## üéØ Specializations & Impact

I specialize in building systems that bridge data, automation, and usability - all with a clear focus on enabling better decisions.

What that looks like in practice:

- Designing **semantic models** and **reporting systems** aligned with real-world decision-making
- Automating **data extraction**, **transformation**, and **integration** across platforms and formats
- Developing **Power BI solutions** that scale across teams while remaining fast and maintainable
- Applying **LLMs** to enhance productivity, reduce friction, and surface deeper analytical insight
- Using **Python**, **TMDL**, and custom scripting to streamline modeling, analysis, and deployment
- Improving **knowledge transfer**, **documentation**, and **process design** for long-term clarity and reuse

Everything I build is designed to be clear, adaptable, and useful - not just for today's project, but for the team that inherits it tomorrow.

## üß¨ Career Highlights

My path started in design and front-end development, but quickly moved toward systems thinking, data architecture, and automation - where I found the perfect mix of creativity, structure, and problem-solving.

Over the years, I've worked as a:

- **Graphic Designer** and **Front-End Developer**, learning to communicate clearly and design with users in mind
- **Support Specialist**, building empathy and solving real problems at the point of impact
- **Data Analyst** and **BI Expert**, turning raw data into insight through modeling, reporting, and storytelling
- **Reporting Analyst** and **Continual Improvement Manager**, leading optimization efforts across reporting and process workflows
- **Senior Cloud Platform Engineer**, designing scalable automation, integrating AI, and building platform-level solutions across teams and business units

I've supported businesses across industries like **Service Management**, **IT Support**, **SLA Monitoring**, **Talent Deployment**, and **Change Enablement** - always with a focus on enabling smarter decisions and building sustainable solutions.
