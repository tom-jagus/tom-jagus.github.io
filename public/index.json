My work bridges data, code, and architecture to help businesses reduce friction, gain clarity, and move forward with confidence. 🧭 Who I Am # I\u0026rsquo;m someone who thrives on solving meaningful problems - not just writing code or building dashboards, but uncovering what really needs fixing and making it better. My background blends data, systems thinking, and a strong bias toward action.\nWhether I\u0026rsquo;m architecting a solution, engineering a workflow, or mentoring a team, I bring structure, empathy, and momentum to every project. I care deeply about building tools people actually use - tools that reduce friction, surface insight, and scale with clarity.\nI believe that well-designed systems don\u0026rsquo;t just improve performance - they empower better decisions and create healthier, more resilient ways of working.\n🧠 How I Work # I approach every project with a balance of structure and adaptability. Whether I\u0026rsquo;m working independently or embedded in a cross-functional team, I aim to bring clarity, reduce ambiguity, and keep momentum moving forward.\nMy process is iterative, outcome-driven, and grounded in real business needs. I ask the right questions up front, ship in small, confident steps, and document decisions as I go - because long-term value comes from systems that are clear, maintainable, and easy to pick up.\nI thrive in environments that value feedback, trust, and purpose. While I prefer agile principles, I know how to apply them flexibly - even in more rigid or legacy-driven workflows.\n🧰 What I Build # I build systems that make data useful, automation sustainable, and insights actionable.\nThat includes:\nAutomated data pipelines that extract, transform, and integrate data across platforms Reporting systems and semantic models that deliver trusted, decision-ready insight LLM-powered tools and workflows that augment analysis, streamline tasks, and surface deeper context Architecture and process design that reduces friction and scales with clarity Custom scripts, interfaces, and automation layers that remove repetition and create momentum Whether it\u0026rsquo;s a self-service dashboard, a robust backend pipeline, or an AI-augmented workflow, I focus on building things that simplify the complex and deliver lasting value.\n🧱 Tools \u0026amp; Technologies # My daily toolkit spans data platforms, scripting languages, automation tools, and AI systems - everything I need to move from raw input to real insight.\nSome of the technologies I rely on most:\nPower BI \u0026amp; Microsoft Fabric for modeling, reporting, and scalable delivery Power Query (M), DAX, and TMDL for building robust semantic layers Python \u0026amp; SQL for scripting, automation, and data engineering LLMs, prompt engineering, and generative AI tools for insight acceleration and intelligent automation Tabular Editor, DAX Studio, and Excel for modeling, diagnostics, and validation Git, Neovim, and terminal-based workflows for versioned, repeatable development 🎯 Specializations \u0026amp; Impact # I specialize in building systems that bridge data, automation, and usability - all with a clear focus on enabling better decisions.\nWhat that looks like in practice:\nDesigning semantic models and reporting systems aligned with real-world decision-making Automating data extraction, transformation, and integration across platforms and formats Developing Power BI solutions that scale across teams while remaining fast and maintainable Applying LLMs to enhance productivity, reduce friction, and surface deeper analytical insight Using Python, TMDL, and custom scripting to streamline modeling, analysis, and deployment Improving knowledge transfer, documentation, and process design for long-term clarity and reuse Everything I build is designed to be clear, adaptable, and useful - not just for today\u0026rsquo;s project, but for the team that inherits it tomorrow.\n🧬 Career Highlights # My path started in design and front-end development, but quickly moved toward systems thinking, data architecture, and automation - where I found the perfect mix of creativity, structure, and problem-solving.\nOver the years, I\u0026rsquo;ve worked as a:\nGraphic Designer and Front-End Developer, learning to communicate clearly and design with users in mind Support Specialist, building empathy and solving real problems at the point of impact Data Analyst and BI Expert, turning raw data into insight through modeling, reporting, and storytelling Reporting Analyst and Continual Improvement Manager, leading optimization efforts across reporting and process workflows Senior Cloud Platform Engineer, designing scalable automation, integrating AI, and building platform-level solutions across teams and business units I\u0026rsquo;ve supported businesses across industries like Service Management, IT Support, SLA Monitoring, Talent Deployment, and Change Enablement -
